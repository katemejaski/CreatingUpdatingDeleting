    <div><h1>Creating Resources</h1>

        <p>POST requests are used to create new resources. A resource can be creted by sending a POST request to a IRL that represents a collection of resources. POST is an HTTP method used to send data to the server, or more specifically, to create an entity in a particular resource.

    </p></div>
    <div> <h2>Basic POST Request Example</h2>
        {
            "data": {
              "type": "node--article",
              "attributes": {
                "title": "My custom title",
                "body": {
                  "value": "Custom value",
                  "format": "plain_text"
                }
              }
            }
          }

          <div><h2>Client-Generated IDs</h2>
            <p>A server MAY accept a client-generated ID along with a request to create a resource. An ID MUST be specified with an id key, the value of which MUST be a universally unique identifier. The client SHOULD use a properly generated and formatted UUID as described in RFC 4122 [RFC4122].
        </p>
        </div>
        <div><h2>Responses</h2>
            <p>201 Created
                If a POST request did not include a Client-Generated ID and the requested resource has been created successfully, the server MUST return a 201 Created status code.
                
                The response SHOULD include a Location header identifying the location of the newly created resource.
                
                The response MUST also include a document that contains the primary resource created.
                
                If the resource object returned by the response contains a self key in its links member and a Location header is provided, the value of the self member MUST match the value of the Location header.</p>
    
                <p>202 Accepted
                    If a request to create a resource has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.</p>
                    
                <p>204 No Content
                    If a POST request did include a Client-Generated ID and the requested resource has been created successfully, the server MUST return either a 201 Created status code and response document (as described above) or a 204 No Content status code with no response document.</p>
                    
                    Note: If a 204 response is received the client should consider the resource object sent in the request to be accepted by the server, as if the server had returned it back in a 201 response.
                    
                <p>403 Forbidden
                    A server MAY return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to create a resource.</p>
                    
                <p>404 Not Found
                    A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request that references a related resource that does not exist.</p>
                    
                <p>409 Conflict
                    A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a POST request to create a resource with a client-generated ID that already exists.
                    
                    A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a POST request in which the resource object’s type is not among the type(s) that constitute the collection represented by the endpoint.
                    
                    A server SHOULD include error details and provide enough information to recognize the source of the conflict.</p>
                    
                <p>Other Responses
                    <ul>
                        <li>A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.</li>
                    
                        <li>A server MAY include error details with error responses.</li>
                    
                        <li>A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.</li></p>
    </div>
    <div><h1>Updating Resources</h1>

        <p> A resource can be updated by sending a PATCH request to the URL that represents the resource.

        The URL for a resource can be obtained in the self link of the resource object. Alternatively, when a GET request returns a single resource object as primary data, the same request URL can be used for updates.
            
        The PATCH request MUST include a single resource object as primary data. The resource object MUST contain type and id members.

    </p>
    <div> <h2>Basic PATCH Request Example</h2>
        PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
        Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
        Accept: application/vnd.api+json
        
        {
          "data": {
            "type": "articles",
            "id": "1",
            "attributes": {
              "title": "To TDD or Not"
            }
          }
        }

    </div>
    <div><h3>Updating a Resource’s Attributes</h3>
        <p>Any or all of a resource’s attributes MAY be included in the resource object included in a PATCH request.
        
        If a request does not include all of the attributes for a resource, the server MUST interpret the missing attributes as if they were included with their current values. The server MUST NOT interpret missing attributes as null values.</p></div>
    <div><h3>Updating a Resource's Relationships</h3>
        <p>Any or all of a resource’s relationships MAY be included in the resource object included in a PATCH request.

            If a request does not include all of the relationships for a resource, the server MUST interpret the missing relationships as if they were included with their current values. It MUST NOT interpret them as null or empty values.
            
            If a relationship is provided in the relationships member of a resource object in a PATCH request, its value MUST be a relationship object with a data member. The relationship’s value will be replaced with the value specified in this member.</p></div>

            <div><h2>Responses</h2>
                <p>202 Accepted
                    If an update request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.</p>
        
                    <p>If a server accepts an update but also changes the resource(s) in ways other than those specified by the request (for example, updating the updated-at attribute or a computed sha), it MUST return a 200 OK response. The response document MUST include a representation of the updated resource(s) as if a GET request was made to the request URL.

                        A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if an update is successful, the client’s current fields remain up to date, and the server responds only with top-level meta data. In this case the server MUST NOT include a representation of the updated resource(s).</p>
                        
                    <p>204 No Content
                        If an update is successful and the server doesn’t update any fields besides those provided, the server MUST return either a 200 OK status code and response document (as described above) or a 204 No Content status code with no response document.
                        
                    <p>403 Forbidden
                        A server MUST return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to update a resource or relationship.</p>
                        
                    <p>404 Not Found
                        A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request to modify a resource that does not exist.

                    A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request that references a related resource that does not exist.</p>
                        
                    <p>409 Conflict
                        A server MAY return 409 Conflict when processing a PATCH request to update a resource if that update would violate other server-enforced constraints (such as a uniqueness constraint on a property other than id).

                        A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a PATCH request in which the resource object’s type and id do not match the server’s endpoint.
                        
                        A server SHOULD include error details and provide enough information to recognize the source of the conflict.</p>
                        
                    <p>Other Responses
                        <ul>
                            <li>A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.</li>
                        
                            <li>A server MAY include error details with error responses.</li>
                        
                            <li>A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.</li></p>
        </div>

    <div><h1>Updating Relationships</h1>

        <p> Although relationships can be modified along with resources (as described above), JSON:API also supports updating of relationships independently at URLs from relationship links.
    </p>
    <div><p>Note: Relationships are updated without exposing the underlying server semantics, such as foreign keys. Furthermore, relationships can be updated without necessarily affecting the related resources. For example, if an article has many authors, it is possible to remove one of the authors from the article without deleting the person itself. Similarly, if an article has many tags, it is possible to add or remove tags. Under the hood on the server, the first of these examples might be implemented with a foreign key, while the second could be implemented with a join table, but the JSON:API protocol would be the same in both cases.</p></div>
    <div><p></p></div>

    <div> <h2>Updating To-One Relationships</h2>
        <p>A server MUST respond to PATCH requests to a URL from a to-one       relationship link as described below.

        The PATCH request MUST include a top-level member named data containing one of:

        a resource identifier object corresponding to the new related resource.
        null, to remove the relationship.</p>
    </div>
    <div><h2>Updating To-Many Relationships</h2>
        <p>A server MUST respond to PATCH, POST, and DELETE requests to a URL from a to-many relationship link as described below.
        
        For all request types, the body MUST contain a data member whose value is an empty array or an array of resource identifier objects.
        
        If a client makes a PATCH request to a URL from a to-many relationship link, the server MUST either completely replace every member of the relationship, return an appropriate error response if some resources can not be found or accessed, or return a 403 Forbidden response if complete replacement is not allowed by the server.</p>

    </div>
<div><h2>Responses</h2>
    <p>202 Accepted
    If a relationship update request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.</p>
    
    <p> No Content
    A server MUST return a 204 No Content status code if an update is successful and the representation of the resource in the request matches the result.</p>
    
    <p>Note: This is the appropriate response to a POST request sent to a URL from a to-many relationship link when that relationship already exists. It is also the appropriate response to a DELETE request sent to a URL from a to-many relationship link when that relationship does not exist.</p>
    
    <p>200 OK
    If a server accepts an update but also changes the targeted relationship(s) in other ways than those specified by the request, it MUST return a 200 OK response. The response document MUST include a representation of the updated relationship(s).
    
    A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if an update is successful, the client’s current data remain up to date, and the server responds only with top-level meta data. In this case the server MUST NOT include a representation of the updated relationship(s).</p>
    
    <p>403 Forbidden
    A server MUST return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to update a relationship. </p>
    
    <p>Other Responses
        <ul>
            <li>A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.</li>
        
            <li>A server MAY include error details with error responses.</li>
        
            <li>A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.</li></p></div>
<div><h1>Deleting Resources</h1>

     <p>An individual resource can be deleted by making a DELETE request to the resource’s URL.    
    </p></div>
    <div><h2>Responses</h2>
        <p>202 Accepted
        If a deletion request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.</p>
        
        <p>204 No Content
        A server MUST return a 204 No Content status code if a deletion request is successful and no content is returned.</p>
        
        <p>200 OK
        A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if a deletion request is successful and the server responds with only top-level meta data.</p>
        
        <p>404 NOT FOUND
        A server SHOULD return a 404 Not Found status code if a deletion request fails due to the resource not existing.</p>
        
        <p>Other Responses
            <ul>
                <li>A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.</li>
            
                <li>A server MAY include error details with error responses.</li>
            
                <li>A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.</li></p></div>
    </div>

<div><h1>Query Parameters</h1>
    <p>Implementation specific query parameters MUST adhere to the same constraints as member names with the additional requirement that they MUST contain at least one non a-z character (U+0061 to U+007A). It is RECOMMENDED that a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“, U+005F LOW LINE, “_”, or capital letter is used (e.g. camelCasing).

        If a server encounters a query parameter that does not follow the naming conventions above, and the server does not know how to process it as a query parameter from this specification, it MUST return 400 Bad Request. </p>
    </div>
<div><h1>Error Objects</h1>
    <h3>An error object MAY have the following members:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>id: a unique identifier for this particular occurrence of the problem.</li>
        <li>links: a links object containing the following members:</li>
        <li>status: the HTTP status code applicable to this problem, expressed as a string value.</li>
        <li>code: an application-specific error code, expressed as a string value.</li>
        <li>title: a short, human-readable summary of the problem that SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization</li>
        <li>detail: a human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. Like title, this field’s value can be localized.</li>
        <li>source: an object containing references to the source of the error.</li>
    </ul>
